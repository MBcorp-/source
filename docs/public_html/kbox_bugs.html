<h1>KBOX limitations and known bugs</h1>

KBOX is (always) a work in progress. There are some known bugs, which may at
some point be fixed. There are, however, some fundamental limitations which
can probably never be fixed, because Android is what it is. I am
in the process of moving the known bugs to the github repository --
please bear with me.

<h2>KBOX is a single-user system</h2>

Like Android (essentially), KBOX is a single user-system. Within
the KBOX shell there is no concept of login or user credentials. All files
are owned by the same user -- the user that owns the terminal emulator.
The user ID is itself aribtrary -- a sequence of numbers with no particular
meaning -- so it is nearly always necessary to specify a user ID
explicitly when using utilities that expect one. Any utility that
expects users to authenticate themslves will likely struggle, although
the <code>kbox-login</code> package provides a stub implementation
of <code>/bin/login</code> that can help in some situations.

<h2>The Android C library lacks multi-byte character support</h2>

A number of applications that now support multi-byte characters have
had to be built with that support disabled, because the Android
C library does not provide the necessary infrastructure.

<h2>Screen width and height will be different from a desktop system</h2>

Many Linux utilities are intended to work with a console 80 characters wide and
25 lines high. Even though the days of dumb terminals are long gone, a
lot of Linux/Unix software originates from those days. It's quite
difficult to get a display 80 columns wide on a small-screen device, and
still be able to read the text without a magnifying glass. Many utilties
provide a way to specify the width of the console; for
example, <code>frotz</code> takes a <code>-w NN</code> switch for this
purpose. A few (very few) utilities can work out the console size using
the <code>ncurses</code> library. Some utilities are hard-coded to
generate 80-column output, and there's no real way to change this
behaviour without modifying the code.
<p/>
To make matters worse, the width and height of the console in characters
will change if you change the font size used by the Android terminal
emulator.

This is a general problem of running console-based software on a device
that was never really intended for such a mode of operation. 10" tablets
behave better in this respect than cellphones.

<h2>Android is firewalled</h2>

Android does not readily allow incoming connections, and the firewall
settings cannot be changed by a non-root user. So, although KBOX
provides SSH and rsync servers, you might not be able to connect 
to these services from outside the device. This behaviour varies
from vendor to vendor. In some cases, a workaround is to make a 
connection from the Android device to the host that will be
initiating the network connection to the device. This may have the 
effect of relaxing the firewall for that particular client/server
combination. However, this is fundamentally a restriction of
Android, and not one that is easy to work around.

<h2>Many networking utilities default to using port numbers in 
the 1-1024 range</h2>

These ports are not available to unprivileged users. This means that even
if you can run an <code>ssh</code> server without being blocked by the
firewall (see above), you'll need to tell both the client and the server
to use a port other than the default of 22. This applies to most
other network daemons also. As a user, you will at least have to
assign non-default port numbers to some utilties.

<h2>OpenSSL issues</h2>

The move from OpenSSL to BoringSSL in Android has caused a heap of problems,
too numerous to list here.
