Building the complete KBOX distribution requires a positively huge amount of software on
the build machine. To make matters worse, some packages can only be built if the
corresponding software _with the same version_ is present on the build machine. "file"
and "python" (Python 3), at least, fall into this category -- they both bootstrap
themselves using an existing installation.

It is impossible to list the requirements for the build of every package, so here
is the list for the complete system (so far as I am able to determine it); most
of these have their own dependencies, which I haven't listed.

flex 
bison 
curl 
wget 
makeinfo 
make 
a properly-configure Android NDK with stand-alone toolchain created
perl
xz
file
diff 
patch
texinfo and its dependencies
gcc/g++ (for the host machine. This is in addition to the NDK)
