This directory contains a tarball of the unzip source code, which is unsatisfactory.
However, later versions (that 2009) of unzip60 don't build using the Google Android
NDK, because they require the iconv library. Conceivably we might base a build on the
old MSDOS makefile or something like that, but it seemed an awful lot of work for
a minor component of the system.
