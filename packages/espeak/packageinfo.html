A text-to-speech engine based on phoneme synthesis. Because there is no direct
access to audio hardware on a non-rooted Android device, this utility requires
the assistance of <code>android-audio-sink</code> to capture and play
the audio stream. The scripts <code>/usr/bin/say</code> and
<code>/usr/bin/sayfile</code> demonstrate how to pipe the audio data into
<code>android-audio-sink</code>. Note that <code>android-audio-sink</code>
is not stated as a dependency, because <code>espeak</code> will work
without it, for (say) writing the audio data to a file.
