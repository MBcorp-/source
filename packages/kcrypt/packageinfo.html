kcrypt is a file encryption and obfuscation utility, originally written twenty
years ago for Windows. It can operate on a directory full of files,
and mangle their filenames as well as encrypting them. Original filenames
are restored on decryption.

On Linux, such operations are usually better handled using encrypted
filesystems. However, I have resurrected the utility for KBOX, because
non-rooted devices don't have access to encrypted filesystems.
