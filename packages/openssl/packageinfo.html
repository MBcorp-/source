OpenSSL is the standard library for handling SSL-encrypted communication, 
which is used by many other utilities. Some Android versions have an
implementation of OpenSSL and, if it works, it is generally better
<i>not</i> to install the KBOX package. Consequently, OpenSSL
is not listed as a formal dependency by any KBOX package, even though
most of them use it.
<p/>
Unfortunately, later Android versions
use a Google variant of OpenSSL called "BoringSSL", which is almost
<i>but not quite</i> compatible with OpenSSL. If you get "undefined
symbol" errors and such-like when trying to run a utility that uses
SSL, then you probably need to install this package. However, you
should bear in mind that this can cause compatibity problems (only
in KBOX) when running programs (such as the Android Java JVM)
from within KBOX. Because the Google "BoringSSL" librarues  have the same
names as the almost-equivalent SSL libraries, this incompatibility
is hard to avoid.
