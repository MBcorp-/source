This package builds, but the program segfaults just after redrawing the display
after invoking vi. I had to stub out a lot of user/group handling stuff
just to get the program to build at all, but I don't think that's the
problem. Something else is returning NULL on Android when it isn't 
expected. Without proper debugging tools, I suspect it will be impossible
to figure out what :/
