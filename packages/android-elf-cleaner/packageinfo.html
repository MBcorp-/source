This is a utility for removing unnecessary symbol table entries left in
KBOX binaries by the Google NDK C compiler. These symbols cause
error messages of the form "unused DT entry: type XXX"; they are
harmless, but irritating. It should be run on the binary that shows
the error and not, for example, on a script that runs the binary, or
a symbolic link to it. Files are modified in place.
