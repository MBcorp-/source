Basic Linux utilities for file handling and similar operations. These are the
full versions of the utilities for which Busybox provides minimal versions.
This package also contains the <code>man</code> pages for the utilities, which
often have somewhat different usage to the Busybox versions.
<p/>
It is expected that KBOX users will probably want to install
<core>coreutils</code> once the system is basically functional, as the Busybox
versions of the standard utilities lack important functionality that may be
important in some applications.
