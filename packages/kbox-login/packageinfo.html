A rudimentary implementation of a login utility. Android has no concept of
users -- at least at the Linux level -- so "logging in" makes little sense.
However, some utilities expect to be able to invoke the login program,
so this package provides one. The single user defined in the file
<code>/etc/kbox-password</code>, and defaults to user <code>kbox</code>
with the same password.
