The Python 3 programming language and runtime system. This is a reasonably 
complete build, but some modules do not even build on Android
(the OSS sound module, for example, which has no corresponding hardware).
Of the modules that do build, some (user/password handling, for example)
will not do anything useful, because there is no underlying implementation
in the Android platform.
